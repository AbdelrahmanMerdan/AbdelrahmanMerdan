As an individual with a strong desire to pursue a career in software engineering, I bring a unique perspective to the field. I have previously attended the University of Toronto where I studied architecture, which has provided me with a diverse set of skills and knowledge. My background in architecture and my passion for technology have motivated me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I can apply my analytical and creative skills to design and develop innovative software solutions.
